She is not any common earth
Water or wood or air,
But Merlin's Isle of Gramarye
Where you and I will fare.

On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays it was Court Hand and Summulae Logicales, while
the rest of the week it was the Organon, Repetition and Astrology. The governess was always
getting muddled with her astrolabe, and when she got specially muddled she would take it out
of the Wart by rapping his knuckles. She did not rap Kay's knuckles, because when Kay grew
older he would be Sir Kay, the master of the estate. The Wart was called the Wart because it
more or less rhymed with Art, which was short for his real name. Kay had given him the
nickname. Kay was not called anything but Kay, as he was too dignified to have a nickname
and would have flown into a passion if anybody had tried to give him one. The governess had
red hair and some mysterious wound from which she derived a lot of prestige by showing it
to all the women of the castle, behind closed doors. It was believed to be where she sat down,
and to have been caused by sitting on some armour at a picnic by mistake. Eventually she
offered to show it to Sir Ector, who was Kay's father, had hysterics and was sent away. They
found out afterwards that she had been in a lunatic hospital for three years.

In the afternoons the programme was: Mondays and Fridays, tilting and horsemanship;
Tuesdays, hawking; Wednesdays, fencing; Thursdays, archery; Saturdays, the theory of
chivalry, with the proper measures to be blown on all occasions, terminology of the chase and
hunting etiquette. If you did the wrong thing at the mort or the undoing, for instance, you
were bent over the body of the dead beast and smacked with the flat side of a sword. This was
called being bladed. It was horseplay, a sort of joke like being shaved when crossing the line.
Kay was not bladed, although he often went wrong.

When they had got rid of the governess, Sir Ector said; "After all, damn it all, we can't have
the boys runnin' about all day like hooligans--after all, damn it all? Ought to be havin' a first-
rate eddication, at their age. When I was their age I was doin' all this Latin and stuff at five
o'clock every mornin'. Happiest time of me life. Pass the port."

Sir Grummore Grummursum, who was staying the night because he had been benighted out
questin' after a specially long run, said that when he was their age he was swished every
mornin' because he would go hawkin' instead of learnin'. He attributed to this weakness the
fact that he could never get beyond the Future Simple of Utor. It was a third of the way down
the left-hand leaf, he said. He thought it was leaf ninety-seven. He passed the port.

Sir Ector said, "Had a good quest today?"

Sir Grummore said, "Oh, not so bad. Rattlin' good day, in fact. Found a chap called Sir Bruce
Saunce Pitï¿½ choppin' off a maiden's head in Weedon Bushes, ran him to Mixbury Plantation
in the Bicester, where he doubled back, and lost him in Wicken Wood. Must have been a
good twenty-five miles as he ran."

"A straight-necked 'un," said Sir Ector.

"But about these boys and all this Latin and that," added the old gentleman. "Amo, amas, you
know, and runnin' about like hooligans: what would you advise?"

"Ah," said Sir Grummore, laying his finger by his nose and winking at the bottle, "that takes a
deal of thinkin' about, if you don't mind my sayin' so."

"Don't mind at all," said Sir Ector. "Very kind of you to say anythin'. Much obliged, I'm sure.
Help yourself to port."

"Good port this."

"Get it from a friend of mine."

"But about these boys," said Sir Grummore. "How many of them are there, do you know?"

"Two," said Sir Ector, "counting them both, that is."

"Couldn't send them to Eton, I suppose?" inquired Sir Grummore cautiously. "Long way and
all that, we know."

It was not really Eton that he mentioned, for the College of Blessed Mary was not founded
until 1440, but it was a place of the same sort. Also they were drinking Metheglyn, not port,
but by mentioning the modern wine it is easier to give you the feel.

"Isn't so much the distance," said Sir Ector, "but that giant What's-'is-name is in the way.
Have to pass through his country, you understand."

"What is his name?"

"Can't recollect it at the moment, not for the life of me. Fellow that lives by the Burbly
Water."

"Galapas," said Sir Grummore.

"That's the very chap."

"The only other thing," said Sir Grummore, "is to have a tutor."

"You mean a fellow who teaches you."

"That's it," said Sir Grummore. "A tutor, you know, a fellow who teaches you."

"Have some more port," said Sir Ector. "You need it after all this questin'."

"Splendid day," said Sir Grummore. "Only they never seem to kill nowadays. Run twenty-
five miles and then mark to ground or lose him altogether. The worst is when you start a fresh
quest."

"We kill all our giants cubbin'," said Sir Ector. "After that they give you a fine run, but get
away."

"Run out of scent," said Sir Grummore, "I dare say. It's always the same with these big giants
in a big country. They run out of scent."

"But even if you was to have a tutor," said Sir Ector, "I don't see how you would get him."

"Advertise," said Sir Grummore.

"I have advertised," said Sir Ector. "It was cried by the Humberland Newsman and Cardoile
Advertiser."

"The only other way," said Sir Grummore, "is to start a quest."

"You mean a quest for a tutor," explained Sir Ector.

"That's it."

"Hie, Haec, Hoc," said Sir Ector. "Have some more of this drink, whatever it calls itself."
"Hunc," said Sir Grummore.

So it was decided. When Grummore Grummursum had gone home next day, Sir Ector tied a
knot in his handkerchief to remember to start a quest for a tutor as soon as he had time to do
so, and, as he was not sure how to set about it, he told the boys what Sir Grummore had
suggested and warned them not to be hooligans meanwhile. Then they went hay-making.

It was July, and every able-bodied man and woman on the estate worked during that month in
the field, under Sir Ector's direction. In any case the boys would have been excused from
being eddicated just then.

Sir Ector's castle stood in an enormous clearing in a still more enormous forest. It had a
courtyard and a moat with pike in it. The moat was crossed by a fortified stone bridge which
ended half-way across it. The other half was covered by a wooden drawbridge which was
wound up every night. As soon as you had crossed the drawbridge you were at the top of the
village street--it had only one street--and this extended for about half a mile, with thatched
houses of wattle and daub on either side of it. The street divided the clearing into two huge
fields, that on the left being cultivated in hundreds of long narrow strips, while that on the
right ran down to a river and was used as pasture. Half of the right-hand field was fenced off
for hay.

It was July, and real July weather, such as they had in Old England. Everybody went bright
brown, like Red Indians, with startling teeth and flashing eyes. The dogs moved about with
their tongues hanging out, or lay panting in bits of shade, while the farm horses sweated

through their coats and flicked their tails and tried to kick the horse-flies off their bellies with
their great hind hoofs. In the pasture field the cows were on the gad, and could be seen
galloping about with their tails in the air, which made Sir Ector angry.

Sir Ector stood on the top of a rick, whence he could see what everybody was doing, and
shouted commands all over the two-hundred-acre field, and grew purple in the face. The best
mowers mowed away in a line where the grass was still uncut, their scythes roaring in the
strong sunlight. The women raked the dry hay together in long strips with wooden rakes, and
the two boys with pitchforks followed up on either side of the strip, turning the hay inwards
so that it lay well for picking up. Then the great carts followed, rumbling with their spiked
wooden wheels, drawn by horses or slow white oxen. One man stood on top of the cart to
receive the hay and direct operations, while one man walked on either side picking up what
the boys had prepared and throwing it to him with a fork. The cart was led down the lane
between two lines of hay, and was loaded in strict rotation from the front poles to the back,
the man on top calling out in a stern voice where he wanted each fork to be pitched. The
loaders grumbled at the boys for not having laid the hay properly and threatened to tan them
when they caught them, if they got left behind.

When the wagon was loaded, it was drawn to Sir Ector's rick and pitched to him. It came up
easily because it had been loaded systematically--not like modern hay--and Sir Ector
scrambled about on top, getting in the way of his assistants, who did the real work, and
stamping and perspiring and scratching about with his fork and trying to make the rick grow
straight and shouting that it would all fall down as soon as the west winds came.

The Wart loved hay-making, and was good at it. Kay, who was two years older, generally
stood on the edge of the bundle which he was trying to pick up, with the result that he worked
twice as hard as the Wart for only half the result. But he hated to be beaten at anything, and
used to fight away with the wretched hay--which he loathed like poison--until he was quite
sick.

The day after Sir Grummore's visit was sweltering for the men who toiled from milking to
milking and then again till sunset in their battle with the sultry element. For the hay was an
element to them, like sea or air, in which they bathed and plunged themselves and which they
even breathed in. The seeds and small scraps stuck in their hair, their mouths, their nostrils,
and worked, tickling, inside their clothes. They did not wear many clothes, and the shadows
between their sliding muscles were blue on the nut-brown skins. Those who feared thunder
had felt ill that morning.

In the afternoon the storm broke. Sir Ector kept them at it till the great flashes were right
overhead, and then, with the sky as dark as night, the rain came hurling against them so that
they were drenched at once and could not see a hundred yards. The boys lay crouched under
the wagons, wrapped in hay to keep their wet bodies warm against the now cold wind, and all
joked with one another while heaven fell. Kay was shivering, though not with cold, but he
joked like the others because he would not show he was afraid. At the last and greatest
thunderbolt every man startled involuntarily, and each saw the other startle, until they
laughed away their shame.

But that was the end of the hay-making and the beginning of play. The boys were sent home
to change their clothes. The old dame who had been their nurse fetched dry jerkins out of a
press, and scolded them for catching their deaths, and denounced Sir Ector for keeping on so

long. Then they slipped their heads into the laundered shirts, and ran out to the refreshed and
sparkling court.

"I vote we take Cully and see if we can get some rabbits in the chase," cried the Wart.

"The rabbits will not be out in this wet," said Kay sarcastically, delighted to have caught him
over natural history.
